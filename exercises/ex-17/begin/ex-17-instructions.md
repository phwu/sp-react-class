# Exercise 17 Instructions
## Objectives
1) Create a store
2) Initialize the state of the component with the state of the store
3) Subscribe to the store with a listener which updates component state  
4) Add a button which dispatches an action to the store 

### Create a store
Create a store via Redux's `createStore` method. 

### Initialize state
In the `constructor`, initialize the state of the component with the state of the store

### Subscribe to changes in state
Add a subscriber to store changes in the `constructor`. When changes are received,
call `setState` to update the state with the changes.

### Dispatch an action to the store
Change `toggleActive` to simply dispatch an event to the store, using the 
`toggleActive` action creator.

### Testing
Load the application in the browser. You should be able to toggle the active 
property of a Payee.
