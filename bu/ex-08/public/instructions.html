<ul>
<li>Add two buttons to the PayeeDetail component, Next and Previous</li>
<li>Attach event handlers to the respective buttons</li>
<li>For now, when the event handler triggers, you can simply log the event to the console</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="add-two-buttons-to-the-payeedetail-component">Add two buttons to the <code>PayeeDetail</code> component</h3>
<p>Add two buttons to the <code>PayeeDetail</code> component.<br>The buttons should have <code>name</code> properties and labels to distinguish them 
from one another.<br>If you want to use Bootstrap classes to make them look better, consider using
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-alignment">alignment classes</a> to center the
buttons and maybe put them in a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-groups-single">button group</a>
as well. </p>
<h3 id="attach-event-handlers-to-their-respective-buttons">Attach event handlers to their respective buttons</h3>
<p>Write two event handlers, <code>handlePrevious</code> and <code>handleNext</code> in the component.<br>(You can use either arrow or classical functions.)<br>The event handlers can log to the console that they fired.
Connect the event handlers to the <code>onClick</code> event on each button. </p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>Open your browser to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>. You can 
interact with the component directly. Your screen should look something like this
